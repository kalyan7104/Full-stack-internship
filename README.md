**Supabase Database Setup**

Create a new Supabase project → Go to https://supabase.com
 and sign in.

Get your API keys and project URL → From Project Settings → API section.

Create the database table → Run this SQL inside the Supabase SQL Editor:

create table public.search_results (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  repo_id bigint not null,
  name text null,
  full_name text null,
  html_url text null,
  description text null,
  stargazers_count integer null,
  language text null,
  owner_login text null,
  keyword text null,
  searched_at timestamp without time zone null default now(),
  constraint repos_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint search_results_repo_id_key unique (repo_id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;

**Update the environment variables in .env:**

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=<your-anon-public-key>
